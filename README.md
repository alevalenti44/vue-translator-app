# vue-translator-app
I've built this app mostly for educational purposes in learning vue more in depth and more efficiently, using the [Yandex API](https://tech.yandex.com/translate/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), at the moment the language selection is quite limited, but i will see about implementing more languages.

Please keep in mind that it only works translating from English.

Feel free to use this code as you wish as it is for practice purposes :).
